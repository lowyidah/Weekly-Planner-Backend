### This project is a responsive website that allows users to easily plan their week. It is available at: https://planner1515.web.app

#### This website is intended for use on Google Chrome (Desktop). The syncing with Google Calendar function is currently not published, hence each user's google email has to be manually added in the back end for the user to gain access to the syncing function.

##### This is the back-end repository.

##### The front-end was built using React, HTML and CSS. It uses React hooks for state management, React Router, and the FullCalendar library. The front-end is deployed on Firebase.

##### The back-end was built using Express.js and PostgreSQL with Knex.js as the query builder. It also manages session cookies for signing in purposes and uses the Google Calendar API. The back-end is deployed on Heroku.
